# Pain Tracker

## About

This app provides a digital alternative to the traditional pen-and-paper pain diary, with a focus
on ease-of-use. The core functionality involves recording pain levels and symptoms at various
points throughout the day. These data points are used to create a graph of “pain history”, a clear
visualisation tool that can be used to make inferences over time.

## How to Use

Using Pain Tracker is easy! To add an entry, just tap the plus button,
fill out the information, and tap Save. Once you've made an entry,
it'll be visible along with the rest of your records on the graph screen.
You can tap on any entry in the graph to get a better look at its details.
(Go to History under the hamburger menu in the top left to get a more in-depth look at your records.)
You can also export your data to a PDF. Just find Export to PDF in the options menu on the top right.
