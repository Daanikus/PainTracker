# PainTracker

Our app will provide a digital alternative to the traditional pen-and-paper pain diary, with a focus
on ease-of-use. The core functionality involves recording pain levels and symptoms at various
points throughout the day. These data points are used to create a graph of “pain history”, a clear
visualisation tool that can be used to make inferences over time.
