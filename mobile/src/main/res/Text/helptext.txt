Using [app name] is easy!

To add an entry, just tap the plus button, fill out the information, and tap Save.

Once you've made an entry, it'll be visible along with the rest of your records on the graph screen. You can tap on any entry in the graph to get a better look at its details. (Go to History under the hamburger menu in the top left to get a more in-depth look at your records.)

You can also export your data to a PDF. Just find Export to PDF in the hamburger menu at the top left.

If you run into any problems, or have other feedback, you can get in touch with us at [let's make an email address for this].

Thanks for using [app name]!
